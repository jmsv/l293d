# Support

If you have any ideas that would make this library even more beautiful, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/jamesevickery/l293d/issues) - or if you're feeling particularly helpful then I would be delighted if you'd fork and submit a pull request! If you want to contribute but don't have an idea, the [issues page](https://github.com/jamesevickery/l293d/issues) is rarely empty and any help would be very much appreciated - especially if the issue is tagged as '[help wanted](https://github.com/jamesevickery/l293d/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)'.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about use or development of `l293d`. Either [submit an issue](https://github.com/jamesevickery/l293d/issues), email me at [jamesevickery.dev@gmail.com](mailto:jamesevickery.dev@gmail.com?Subject=L293D) or tweet/DM me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jamesevickery).

If you'd like to support my open-source development while I'm a poor university student, feel free to buy me a coffee!
